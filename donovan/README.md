# Project Two: A Message About Community 

by Donovan Lee


## Project Overview

In this project, the goal is to animate lyrics from the video. The lyrics from the music is meant to represent the idea of community, like where people with similar interest join together, or people join together to reach a similar goal.

The song chosen the lyrics from are from are Scatman John's famous tracks, "Scatman's World". The song has a focus on making a community, peacefully living togther. 

The reaosn for the song being chosen is due to the overall message of the song. The song gives an optimistic tone, allowing for anyone to come together and work with each other in many issues.

The song also reflects off of reality a bit, focusing on helping tell a truth about any issues people have. The song even specifies on how people on the inside matters the most, and not the physical outside of a person.

From many articles on him, Scatman John is a man who was born with a stuttering speech impediment. With this knowledge, he created his musical career, utilizing his speaking patterns to help in singing, especially in "scat singing", there the singer imitates an  instruments with inaudible words to match the rhythm. The singer wants to help create a community of people who feel that their conditions are pushing them back and many others. This sentiment is best reflected off from the lyrics, trying to bring everyone together.

When it comes to a personal commection to the song, it displays a nostalgic tone or optimism, while pushing the overall message of community. Growing up throughout the 2000s and early 2010s, the tone of optimism and acceptance for many people have been either, quite prominent or sometimes, rarely seen. This song gives off an accepting feeling to its lyrics and a uplifting, positive tone to the atmosphere and persectives on life..

## Technical Overview

In this project, the softwares and applicaitons used are the "Visual Studio Code" software to create the animations. The files on this project mostly used a mix of HTML and CSS (mostly CSS). Each page has their own separate HTML file, while many of them share one or more CSS file to help with the styling an animations.

Each CSS file has each element have their positioning into absolute [to allow the elements to not affect the pages other elements,vwhile also have custom placement], while using the various CSS code, like "left", "top", and/or "bottom", to position the text.

From my lessons on typography, the maniuplation of font styling, like the font sizes, weight, and color to have the priority of attention be placed upon them, help push a style and tone to help match the style of the song. To allow the viewer to view the text that links to the other pages, I have the text significantly larger than the other text, while using the custom "Micro 5" typeface from Google Fonts. 

The linked text uses various means to make itself stand out. The color can be different from the other texts' "black" or "white".  The text would also glow (using "text-shadow") and some even has a small, translucent reflection below them (using "-webkit-box-reflect" for this effect) to mimic the glowing text floating over a body of water.
