"what does community to me?" by hope marie david

# project overview

this website is a small embodiment of what community means to me through written, animated words and typography. The song that I have used in this website is "Ribs" by Lorde. Although this song does not have strong implications of community at the surface, this song speaks to me personally about community and what it means to be within a community of people living life and growing old. I also have an emotional attachment to this song, and it was something that I listened to growing up in my own community. This song has some undertones of nostalgia and wishing to go back to how it was, but growing together and being supported by your own community can make something scary (like growing older) easier. 

Through this song, I was able to appreciate my community that is made up of people who continuously choose to be in my life, whom are also aging at the same rate as I am. 

# technical overview

This website was created within Visual Studio Code and consists of three HTML pages, all styled with various hover tranformations, CSS animations, and two Adobe Font families. On each page, the last word includes a link to the next, except for the third and final page. The background color of each page is the color, #2c3439, which was done in order to make the white text less harsh on the viewer's eyes and easier to read. The background color was also adjusted to make the colored text easier to read.

There are several hover animations on each line of text, but there are also different @keyframe animations on other lines. These animations simulate neon letters or streetlamps that flicker in the night. There are some words that include hover transformations that change from one font to another to further emphasize the words other then their color.
