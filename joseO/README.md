# Project 2: A Community Project
by Jose Ochoa

# project overview 

I created a website that exclusively relies on text and color for interactivity. My objective was to represent the concept of community through these two limited elements. 

I chose the poem ‘I Hear America Singing’ by Walt Whitman because it celebrates diversity within America. I think there are many problems with Americans, but I think the biggest community I am a part of is my nationality, American. The poem includes a diverse amount of people, from jobs to gender, and it celebrates the unity of them all as Americans. They all sing with pride and enthusiasm together, which is what I imagine a happy community looks like. 

When I read the poem, I get a sense of happiness and hopefulness, which I feel is an important identity in all my communities. The poem also has a variety of descriptive words that seem fun to work within our project. Even in the title, the word singing can be personified in many ways, which intrigued me. The poem is also small in length, so I can spend time on the interactions rather than the amount of words I have to make interactions. 


# technical overview

The project consists of twelve HTML pages and a single CSS page. A recurring design element on all HTML pages is the gradient text, 'singing,' which serves to unify the entire website.

The first HTML page features a neon light text with the word 'hear' gradually increasing in size. This effect is intended to draw the user's attention to the word 'hear' and its significance. I created the neon animation with keyframes that had text shadows. The increased size animation had a scale transformation. 

The HTML page, with many others, had a cursor animation with the neon light text. I used keyframe animations that had two names: cursor and typing. The text has a hidden overflow and a no wrap on the white space to keep the line of text in a single line. 

The third HTML page had a slide-down animation with keyframes. The transform and translate CSS code were used. 

The fifth HTML page has a boat-rocking animation that uses keyframes and transforms the translated code. 

On the seventh HTML page, we've introduced a background color change and text color alteration to represent the transition from morning to afternoon, as reflected in the poetry line.

On the ninth HTML page, I have a keyframe increase size animation that infinitely increases the size of the text with a transform scale CSS code. 

The eleventh HTML page has all the text with the neon text animation and a 'read again' button with a Hoover effect, where it changes the background color to yellow while changing the text to white. 

# acknowledgment 

I referenced a lot of TikTok pages on multiple animations.

I used 'Only Code Channel'  on TikTok for the neon light animation. 

I also used YouTube as a resource. I used 'Clueless Expert' as a cursor reference. The video I referenced was titled 'Typewriter Animation in CSS.'

I also referenced the class's transform lecture to do a lot of simple scaling and translating animations.
